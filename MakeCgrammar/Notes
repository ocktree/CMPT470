define op

end define

define assign_operator
  | '=
  | '==

Compounds removes the automatic space inserted between two characters. EX: = = turns into ==
compounds
  == := 
end compounds

Recursion
define expression
  [ID_or_Number]
  | [expression] '+ [expression]
  | [expression] '- [expression]
  | [expression] '/ [expression]
  | [expression] '* [expression]
